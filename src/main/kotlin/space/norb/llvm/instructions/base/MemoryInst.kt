/**
 * Abstract base class for all memory instructions.
 *
 * Memory instructions operate on memory locations through pointers.
 * These instructions can read from, write to, or allocate memory.
 *
 * Examples of memory instructions include:
 * - AllocaInst: allocates memory on the stack
 * - LoadInst: reads a value from memory
 * - StoreInst: writes a value to memory
 * - GetElementPtrInst: computes pointer addresses
 * - AtomicRMWInst: atomic read-modify-write operations
 * - CmpXchgInst: atomic compare-and-swap operations
 *
 * In the untyped pointer model, all pointers are of type "ptr" regardless
 * of the type of data they point to.
