# Kotlin-LLVM Logo

This directory contains the logo and related assets for the Kotlin-LLVM project. The logo is designed to represent the fusion of Kotlin programming language and LLVM compiler infrastructure.

## Acknowledgements

The logo shape mirrors [the old llvm logo](https://llvm.org/Logo.html) from the LLVM website, as well as the simplified version of this logo in the [issues section for simple-icons](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/issues/1936). It was proposed as a possible logo for LLVM in this repo. The released logo comes under the CC0 license.

The color scheme is adapted to mirror the [Kotlin logo colors](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kotlin_Icon.png).
