# Architecture Documentation

This directory collects the architectural notes that reflect the code currently shipped in the repository.

- **[Architecture Overview](overview.md)** – outlines the implemented packages (`core`, `types`, `structure`, `builder`, `instructions`, `values`, `visitors`) and how they interact

Future architectural write-ups should stay grounded in the existing Kotlin sources. When new subsystems land, extend the overview (or add focused documents) so the guidance here mirrors reality.
