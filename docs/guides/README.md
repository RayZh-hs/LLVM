# User Guides and Tutorials

This directory currently contains two source-backed guides:

- **[Getting Started Guide](getting-started.md)** – cloning the project, running the build, and emitting a first function with `Module` and `IRBuilder`
- **[Testing Guide](testing.md)** – how the existing unit and integration suites exercise the implementation

When new workflows are documented, keep the content focused on code paths that exist in `src/main/kotlin` so readers can verify every claim in the repository.
